# Forecasting-Power-Usage-for-a-Residential-House-Time-series-Data
Forecasting power usage for a single residential home from historical data of 4 years using ARIMA model

In this project, I have considered a dataset with hourly power usage of a two-storied house located in Houston, Texas.
The objective of the project is to analyze the time series data and estimate the power usage for a given day using the historical usage data and weather condition of that day. Algorithms used for forecasting are multivariate regression model, Autoregressive and ARIMA model. Performances of different models are evaluated using accuracy measures and better model is decided. Then this time series model is fitted to forecast power usage for future period.
